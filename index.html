      <h2>TRY THE BEST COFFEE IN TOWN!</h2>
      <p>
        Coffee is not just a simple drink prepared by someone. Coffee is a
        moment, and we will show you that. Phrases like “How about grabbing a coffee?”
        or even “Let’s make some coffee?” show that one of the moments that most
        strengthen bonds with others is about to happen. Light or strong? With or
        without sugar? Would you like sugar or sweetener? These are phrases we
        hear everywhere. Almost everywhere there are people, there is also coffee.
        We seem intrinsically connected to coffee. Here at Manhattan, we will
        serve you with great care our beloved Amaro’s Coffee, directly from our
        coffee plantation in Minas Gerais. For us, coffee is serious business and
        deserves the utmost care.

      <h2>WHAT IS MANHATTAN COFFEE?</h2>
      <p>
        According to the SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) Sensory Evaluation
        Methodology, used worldwide, a specialty coffee is any coffee that scores
        at least 80 points on the scale (which goes up to 100). Manhattan Coffee
        stands out in fragrance, body, balance, sweetness, and flavor, featuring
        notes that may be fruity, herbal, or sweet like caramel and chocolate.
        We can compare it to wine, as Manhattan coffee can also be appreciated
        for its sensory characteristics and not just for its caffeine content.
        Thanks to excellent cultivation standards, post-harvest care, and roasting,
        you will be able to experience different and delicious types of coffee.

      <h2>DISCOVER MANHATTAN GOURMET COFFEE</h2>
      <p>
        The characteristics of Manhattan gourmet coffee are very distinctive.
        Its body depends on the blend variety: the heavier it feels in the mouth,
        the fuller the body. The lighter it feels, the lighter the body. Our
        gourmet coffee is highly rated throughout the production process to
        ensure it has no defects. The aroma is very noticeable, and customers can
        clearly perceive it. It may vary among four aroma profiles: floral,
        citrus, chocolatey, and fruity. These variations result from Arabica beans.
        Everything depends on the roast level — the lighter the roast, the higher
        the acidity.
